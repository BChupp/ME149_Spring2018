# Topic 05: MIMO Control

## Lecture:

The first lecture in this topic covers a variety of topics related to trajectory tracking
control and underactuated systems. The second lecture focuses on infinite-horizon LQR as
well as trajectory tracking (finite horizon) LQR.

## Homework:

The homework for this topic guides the student through designing a LQR hover controller
for a planar quadrotor, and then a LQR trajectory-tracking controller to guide the
quadrotor through a flip manauver.
