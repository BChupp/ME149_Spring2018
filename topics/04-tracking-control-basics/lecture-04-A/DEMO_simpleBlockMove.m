% DEMO:  simple block move
%
% This demo shows how to use a simple PD controller to move a point mass
% from point A to point B, and then looks at how motor saturation affects
% performance.
%
% For students:
%   - experiment with changing all of the parameters: see what happens!
%
% Examples:
% 
%   - set the damping (xi) to each of the following values: 
%       xi = 0  --> no damping = oscillate forever
%       xi = 0.2  --> under-damped: slowly decaying oscillations
%       xi = 0.8  --> under-damped: rapidly decaying oscillations
%       xi = 1.0  --> critically damped: fastest response w/o overshoot
%       xi = 1.2  --> overdamped: fast response, no overshoot
%       xi = 3.5  --> overdamped: slow response, no overshoot
%
%   - adjust the natural frequency of the controller (wn), keeping other
%   parameters fixed. Notice that larger wn will cause larger actuation an
%   a faster response.
%
%   - if the maximum actuation (uMax) is large enough, then this system
%   will behave exactly like a linear system. As uMax is reduced you will
%   eventually notice that it clips the actuation for the beginning of the
%   simulation. When this occurs we get two issues:
%   
%       1) actuator saturation is handled with a simple clamping function,
%       which introduces a discontinuity in the controller. This means that
%       the dynamics that are passed to ode45 are now discontinuous. As a
%       result, the solution that ode45 gives wil not actully satisfy the
%       accuracy that it promises, and we may see "ringing" in the
%       solution: a numerical artifact that happens when we use a
%       high-order method to simulate a system with a discontinuity. That
%       being said, for practical purposes the solution obtained by ode45
%       is good enough to illustrate out point. The correct way to handle
%       this discontinuity is with the events feature in ode45, but this
%       would introduce a significant amount of extra code and is a topic
%       for another time.
%
%       2) the pole-placement method that we used for setting Kp and Kd
%       implicitly assumes that the system is perfectly linear. If the
%       actuator saturates then we no longer have any guarentees about what
%       the behavior will be. For example, it is possible to get an
%       overdamped controller to overshoot, even though this will never
%       happen for a truely linear system.
%   
%   - What happens if you set a non-zero reference velocity? The system
%   will never reach its target! There is no steady-state solution where
%   you can satisfy a constant position and a non-zero constant velocity.
%   As a result, you will get a steady-state error in both position and
%   velocity.
