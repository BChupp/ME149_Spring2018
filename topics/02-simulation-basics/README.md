# Topic 02: Simulation Basics

## Lecture:

In this topic we will focus on all things related to Euler's method,
starting with a basic conceptual understanding and working up to a more
formal derivation using a Taylor series.

## Homework:

For homework you will simulate two systems using Euler's method:
the simple pendulum and the Lorenz system.
I will provide a set of template code to help you get started.
You will also learn one important Matlab skill: working with anonymous functions.

## Programming Concepts:
- function files
- anonymous functions / lambda functions / function handles
- plotting in 3D
- interfaces (informal)
- vectorized math calculations (`a = b .* c;`)
- array operations and slicing (`d = D(1,:);`)
- basics of coding style

## Mathematics Concepts:
- Euler's Method (`zNext = zPrev + h * dzPrev`)
  - scalar
  - vector
- second-order equation represented as first-order system
- basic system dynamics
- intro to numerical solutions to differential equations
