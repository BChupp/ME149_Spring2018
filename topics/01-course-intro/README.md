# Topic 01: Introduction to Optimal Control for Robotics


## Lecture:

The first lecture for this course is focused on providing a basic understanding of optimal control and how it is applied to robotics. In-class discussion focusing on trajectory optimization and policy optimization. We also covered course logistics.

# Homework Assignment:

The homework for this lecture is designed to test your basic programming and mathematics background. The first problem asks you to write a simple Matlab program to plot a fractal, and the second asks you to compute and then plots some derivatives.
