This document contains the mathematical details for constructing a smooth spline through a data set.
In addition to fitting the data, the spline should be smooth (jerk-minimizing) and satisfy known boundary conditions precisely.
The resulting spline can be generated by solving a linear system ($x = A \backslash b$).
