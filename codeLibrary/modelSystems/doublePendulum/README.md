# Model System:  Double Pendulum

Derivation, simulation, and animation for a simple double pendulum.
Assumptions: massless links, point masses at the elbow and wrist, ideal torque actuation at shoulder and elbow.

## `DERIVE_doublePendulum.m`

Derives the equations of motion for the double pendulum, as well as the forward kinematics and energy.

## `MAIN_doublePendulumPassiveSimulation.m`

Use ode45 to compute a simulation of the double pendulum.
Control effort is set to zero to create passive motion.

The result of the simulation is displayed as an interactive animation, which
allows the user to pause, go frame-by-frame, and adjust the playback rate.

## `autoGen_*.m`

All files that start with `autoGen_` are automatically generated by the Matlab symbolic toolbox.

## `doublePendulum*.m`

All files that start with `doublePendulum` are the main interface functions for the double pendulum.
Type `>> help doublePendulum<Name>.m` to see how to use each function.
