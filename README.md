# Tufts ME 149: Optimal Control for Robotics, Spring 2018

This is the home of the content for *Optimal Control for Robotics*,
a master's level course at Tufts University (Course Listing: ME 149-06, Spring 2018).

## Course Description:
Students taking this course will learn the basics of optimal control for robotics applications. There will be a strong focus on trajectory optimization and trajectory-tracking controllers, and assignments will focus on applications and implementation, rather than on theory. In the first part of the course students will learn the core concepts of optimal control: programming, simulation, control, and optimization. In the second part of the course the students will put these concepts together to design and stabilize reference trajectories in simulation. The topics covered in this course are used in a variety of applications, including aircraft, satellites, robot arms, legged robots, quad-rotor helicopters.

## File Structure:
 - `codeLibrary`: General-purpose Matlab code that will be used across multiple assignments.
 - `courseInfo`: Here lives the syllabus and other high-level information about the course.
 - `supplement`: Supplemental material for the course that is not tied to a specific lecture.
 - `topics`: Content for lectures, assignments, and solutions.
